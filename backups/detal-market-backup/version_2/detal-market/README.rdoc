No products on home page

The homepage in the Spree Fancy theme is generated using 3 taxons, "Slider", "Featured", and "Latest".

Make sure your products are included in those so they are shown in the appropriate section of the homepage.
---

You can now go into `config/initializers/spree.rb` and add this code (a
little nicer)


Number of products shown per page (pagination)

Spree.config do |config|
# Example:
# Uncomment to override the default site name.
# config.site_name = "Spree Demo Site"
config.products_per_page = 100
end
Seems to be the way they want you to do it now.
Thanks Ewan,
